# Basic-Calculator
The Basic Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project serves as a great exercise for practicing front-end development skills

# Features
● Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.
● User -Friendly Interface: Designed with a clear layout that includes buttons for
digits, operators, and special functions.
● Error Handling: Displays an error message if an invalid calculation is
attempted (e.g., division by zero).
● Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work on various screen
sizes.

# Technologies Used
● HTML
● CSS
● JavaScript

# How to Use the Calculator
1. Input Numbers: Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers into the
calculator.
2. Select Operations: Click on the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to select the
desired arithmetic operation.
3. Clear Input: Click the "C" button to clear the input display.
4. Calculate Result: Click the "=" button to calculate and display the result of the
entered expression.
5. Error Handling: If an invalid operation is attempted (e.g., dividing by zero), the
display will show "Error".

# Additional Features
While the basic calculator currently supports standard arithmetic operations, you can
enhance it by adding the following features:
● Square Root Functionality: Implement a button that calculates the square root
of the displayed number.
● Percentage Calculations: Add functionality to calculate percentages.
● Memory Functions: Implement memory features such as:
● M+ (Add current display to memory)
● M- (Subtract current display from memory)
● MR (Recall memory value)
● MC (Clear memory)

# Code Structure
The project consists of the following files:
● index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
● styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the calculator's layout and design.
● script.js: Contains the JavaScript code that implements the calculator's
functionality.
